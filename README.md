# Welcome Project

This is the first Python project for my students.  
The goal of this exercise is to learn how to create and run a basic Python script.

---

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- `welcome.py`: A simple script that prints a welcome message.
- `add_to_list_end.py`: Script showing different methods to add elements to the end of a list or similar structures.
- Future exercises will be added later.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the folder in **VS Code**.  
2. Run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Programming-instructor/FirstPythonExercise.git
cd FirstPythonExercise
python welcome.py
