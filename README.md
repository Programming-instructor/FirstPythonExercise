# Welcome Project 🐍

This is the first Python project for my students.  
The goal of this exercise is to learn how to create and run a basic Python script.

## 🧠 What’s Inside
- `welcome.py`: A simple script that prints a welcome message.
- Future exercises will be added later.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python welcome.py

## How to run on terminal
- git clone https://github.com/Programming-instructor/FirstPythonExercise.git
